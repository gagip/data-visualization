marketing
Usally a great game except if they release a new feature then it is unplayable until a month after...But still the best competitive shooter game on the market
Yeah okay pretty cool. Learnt some Russian, passed my exam. Thnx10/13
Great case opening simulator9/11
If you want something totally different than CoD (mechanics wise), then this is the game for you!! I hvae played it for a while now and I am still enjoying it!
this game is so cool,but the new update sucks !
Nice Game!
VERY GODD
Recommend this game to anyone who wants to take an FPS game more competitively. Game is absolutely addicting especially with a well balanced ranking system after the update and it is very cheap. A unique market that have their own economy for Skins, Case keys and etc. For those who have 5 to 10 dollars to spend and haven't yet buy this game. I'd recommend you to buy this. :)
it is the best game if you are only coming from ps3/4 and xbox360/1 gaming well if you already have  played pc games then you well find these easy to get youst two. It is a lot like battlefeild were you would comunatet with freinds and team mates. good look and watch your back
This game has evolved so much over the years... and after 6 years since playing, it's impressed me yet again with the sheer level of improvement and fun! Still evolving... and awesome graphics! Would be nice to have more Music Kits!
Just bought the game yesterday night, amazing. Absolutely amazing! I love it. Keep up the work!
AWESOME !
Good
ayyy
good game
gud gem to play :)
good game.
Good game with big skill cap. Don't get bored easily. Takes some time to learn :)
Neeee
Not the biggest fan of first person shooters (except for some call of duties or actual realistic ones) but CS:GO is amazing. But there is a little downside to it and that is the fact that a match is 30-45 minutes on average and it's really hard to get started once you first pick it up, and drops are hard to get. Either way, GG.
This is counter-strike and i dont find this Global Offensive
good
YES YES YES
COUNTER STRIKE GLOBAL OFFENSIVE,Best game to play if u suck at cod
ansaya laruin
Takes a bit of getting used to but quickly becomes one of the most addicting games. The new method of having to reach level 3 sucks but if you keep an open mind you may find this game to be a lot of fun.
Good
nyan
awesoome . . . . .  . . . .  . ..  ..  -.-
This is Super GAME! My Best GAME!

nice game
SO OP
Addicting, fun, and challenging all at the same time.Graphics are nothing exceptional, but CS:GO makes up for in tactics and teamwork.One of the best games to play with friends.TIPS ON HOW TO BE GOOD:1. Play2. Mic3. Pray to Gaben
Yeaaa i recommend this game so hard its really fun.
Niceee..
?????????? peli
Great tactical shooter, lots of fun with friends, also bonus russian lessons. win win
<3
Loli's for days yo
GOOD GAME !!!
Good game, but @Valve you guys needs to do something about obvious hackers.
A big miss to people who didn't play it
All it's recoil weirdness creates an interesting challenge of managing accuracy, fire rate, move speed and time out of cover, which you compensate with teamwork and tactics. It's the smartest type of balance: you're somewhat powerful; not a laser accurate ADS shooter, where managing your own gun and reflexes to win, and you're not too weak; being super smart or super crafty means you can make the difference on your team.Only thing that ruins it is people that somehow know the bullet fire patterns that aren't random. :/
Good Game ;)
dont even own the game 10/10 game
Sick Game!
Bots <3
swaggggg
good great aweful, well see how his latest op plays out.
Really good game :P Lot of russian kids playing, but mute them and all will be fine ;)
it's no sim city but it's ok. Gets abit confusing at times.
Ez winz Ez skinz
This game is great... The overwatch is so flawed. I know some dirty secrets abotu it I wish i never knew. But it is good I do know because I know for sure I was banned for no reason. I still reccomend this game. Just be careful on competitive matches, if you get reported... Your almost guaranteed to be screwed.
Been playing since 1.6... I dont think i will ever stop
nice game.:D
Best of the Best! :D10/10
super kawaii desu~~~
yesh this game is better then cod EVRY day
If you don't already own this game then shame on you.10/10 would headshot again
good game
???????? ????????,?????????????? ????????????????????
:(
A game where your true skill depends on how expensive your knife is! Hell I am Supreme Legendary Epic Quad Class Eagle Globe and nobody at my rank DOESN'T have a knife! We're so unique that we all have different colors and some of our knives even count kills! So don't plan on buying this game unless you want to waste another $1200 on your miserable ????????ing life, loser.
ROAD TO GLOBAL ELITE (Y)
The best game! I suggest for everyone. Russians make me stronger.
i enjoyed
good fps game
:D
cant stop rushing B.
wew
Epic game one of the best I have played, And a great choice for attacking and defending / Downside is if you wish to show off you better buy some skins / But at the end of the day the game is particulary a defending and attacking game I honeslty think this is one of the best games ever ! On steam
Good things in csgo is fun and very interesting gaming.You on csgo can learn Russian and it is for me very good.You can meet a lot of people.Bad things in csgo is that Rank up sistem and ban sistem,for example if you win 3 games in competitive and lose 2 you will be de rankedand i if you kick from the competitive game 2 noob players you will be banned for some hours or 7 days from competitive.
In this game you will do this.1) Check every profile2) Report everyone3) Hate every country4) Spam 'ez pz' even if you win 16-14 5) Voice_Enable 0 6) Ask to get kicked from competitive game because you lost pistol round7) Curse everything 8) Play d2 forever9) 10/1010) Rush b -By far the most masterpiece game ever-
very good game, skill based, hackers every now and then but you get that with all games.
Awesome game!!! But some few bugs on linux, I can`t complete the weapons course once I just can`t pick the first weapon. And it could let me use the Vulkan istead of openGL, just saying.
Good game!
Greate Game Good For A s t e t i c  PC's Also I Have A Gambling Addiction Now When Ever I Get Money i go on csgowild and loss it if you want to help use code "Smy9ze" for a free $1 xD

Love the game and its gameplay but R.I.P my families econemy...
Haven't seen russians yet so i'll give this game a thumbs up
you just have to play this... you have to
Honestly , it's a love/hate relationship with this game. It's extremely fun, i'm glad about the whole "Prime" system implemented, actually gives me some motivation to get my rank back without running into so many hackers.
Me: Whereppl: RUSH B P90 16-0 ez winMe: ok.result: Rekt 1-169/10 :v

Russian Rage Simulator 20122/10
Need that achievement
it's okay but the XP mechanic is rubbish!
skillozone
Entering in game, love the game, playing with russians, f*ck the life :D
This game is a solid game with updates and patches that come out pretty decently compared to other Valve games. It has a decent community and the game is pretty fun itself. The first 1000 hours I was hooked to this game but after that, the game started to die off for me. Overall, the game is pretty solid and good with some annoying hit reg issues. Would recommend to a friend.
Very nice.
This game has absorbed my time and life. Its awesome and destroying me at the same time.
Probably the best FPS game ever, thanks Valve <3
 Don't start to play it! It's a trap!
hehaw
Very nice game :)

i like this game, but only when im playing with friends
ONE OF THE BEST GAME IN STEAM PROBLEM IS CSGO'D(HITBOXES/SHOT REGISTRY)
its decent i guess.for real dont get too invested in it, its not worth stressing yourself out over it, otherwise pretty enjoyable.
Awesome Game!
Don't you open up that interwebz, Don't you turn up that field of view
Very nice game...you should play it!
Russians, hackers, kids, trolls, wannabesawwww, so awsome.
10-9
One of the most competitie FPS games i have played to date!I love it!
when u get a higher rank. more chaeaters are going to appear. haha
perfect game
its fun, until you meet the squeaker 12 year olds, if you see or hear any, play rock or metal music and theyll leave or just kick them
GOOD GAME!!!!
Awesome game 10/10 I LOVE IT!
Look at the Trailer, Now back at the Game, Now back at the trailer and back at the Game the Game isn't the Trailer but it could be if Valve Anti-Cheats Worked to its full potential.
good
After remember playing Counter Strike Source when I was young, I decided to pick up this game and play it. I felt like i was in my old self, playing a better version of Counter Strike Source. The game is wonderful for all the people that have played earlier versions of this game, but this game is also great for new comers of this series. The graphics, is fine, but is not as good as COD, Battlefield and many other titles. The game has some problems, such as hacking and smurfing. The Rank System of CS GO is truly a piece of art. It ranks you in a skill group going from Silver 1 - Global Elite. It makes sure you're not with Global Elites when your Silver 1. But thats when the smurfing problem comes in. People may create a second account, or play bad on purpose to derank you from your current rank. While that might not be a problem when your Silver 1, anything above silver 1, its worse then hell.Now for the full review.Graphics 7/10Gameplay 9/10Noob Friendliness 2/10My problems with the Noob Friendliness is because in casual and deathmatch, which is the only modes (expect for demolition and gun game) that noobs play, can be linked up with professionals, globals, supremes etc.Overall Rating:9/10 Worth your 15 dollars, or 5 dollars when on sale.
super good
Great game for meeting russian friends.
get it!
don't get this if you value your life
awsum
Fap
I love this game
Do they Really Need a Review ?? You are Stupid if your looking for one .... !
